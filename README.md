# 0x11. C - printf team project


## Group Project

> "I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life."

This is a group project aimed at implementing a custom `printf` function in C that produces output according to a given format.

## Project Goals

1. **Education** is when you read the fine print. **Experience** is what you get if you don't.

   Handle the following conversion specifiers:
   - `%c`: Character
   - `%s`: String
   - `%d`, `%i`: Signed decimal integer
   - `%u`: Unsigned decimal integer
   - `%o`: Unsigned octal
   - `%x`, `%X`: Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase)

2. With a face like mine, I do better in **print**.

   Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
   - `%R`: Rot13-encoded string

3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in **print**.

   Handle the following conversion specifiers:
   - `%p`: Pointer address

4. **Nothing** in fine print is ever good news.

   Use a local buffer of 1024 chars to optimize write calls.

5. My weakness is wearing too much **leopard print**.

   Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
   - `%l`: Print the length of the string

6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in **print**.

   Handle the following conversion specifier:
   - `%S`: Print a custom string

7. The big print gives and the small print takes away.

   Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
   - `+`: Print a plus sign (+) for positive numbers
   - ` ` (space): Print a space for positive numbers instead of a plus sign

8. **Sarcasm** is lost in print.

   Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
   - `l`: Print long integers
   - `h`: Print short integers

9. Print some money and give it to us for the **rain forests**.

   Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance.

    Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of **print**.

    Handle the `0` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print whatever, suddenly I would see a collection.

    Handle the `-` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13. **Print** is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party.

    Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
    - `%b`: Print a binary representation of an unsigned decimal integer

14. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring.

    Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
    - `%R`: Reverse the string

15. All the above options work well together.
